        <p>Hi, I'm Beni, and this is my very first task at Green Fox Academy. My job is to make a website own my own. I don't know if it's going to be good, but I will try my best. If you have any questions, contact me. Wish me luck, bye! :-)</p>
        <p>Everything I've done, everything I'll do today, everything I'll ever do, I do to protect this world.</p>
